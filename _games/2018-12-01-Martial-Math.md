Developed for the first Game Creator Space Game Jam, MARTIAL MATH was a project completed sporadically over a month. 

The game, inspired by the theme "Learning", is akin to the old flash games played in school libraries. 

The majority of the coding was done in just a few hours.

Fight off against fellow sword fighters with this math game. Ranging in difficulty for kids of all ages. Test your speed math against your opponents and prove the pen is mightier than the sword!

PS. If it were up to me. I'd set the source code on fire
