ICARUS is a vertical endless runner, developed in a total of 50 hours. Drawing inspiration from Doodle Jump's mechanics and Journey's aesthetics, the game's core mechanics were developed in the first week, with subsequent focus on polish and new obstacles for the map generation system. 

Fly high with the fire of Icarus. Cast your blaze and guide your kite to the heavens, or at least as close as you can get. Avoid the obstacles that pass your way and get the kite as high as you can!

Rack up points and use them to buy different items in the shop to help you on your way; Like new skins for your kite and new effects for your flame.
