HITCHED is a parking puzzle game guaranteed to test your patience. Developed solo in just 48 hours for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam under the theme 'Joined Together', it focuses on the challenge of reversing a vehicle with a hitched trailer.

This game showcases my growth as a developer with its polished gameplay.

This game is primarily about the struggle of trying to drive with a trailer taken to the extreme. Levels will mostly involve reversing with your trailer and trying to avoid pylons. Then just adding some explosive barrels to the mix to keep up the pressure.

The game works with both keyboard and gamepad, although I didn't set up the gamepad with any of the menus, so keep a mouse close by.

I wish I could have added some more features but unfortunately, I wasted the first 6 hours of the Jam on a prototype I scrapped. Also in case, it isn't obvious I'm not a 3-D modeler, so try to look past the block cars lol.
