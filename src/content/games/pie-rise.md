What's better than freshly-baked pies? Created during the 2019 Global Game Jam in Edmonton, this charming management game transforms the theme "The Feeling Home Gives You" into a delightful narrative about growth, timing, and the occasional hungry raccoon.

## Development Background

A diverse team of five creators, including artists, writers, and programmers, came together for 48 hours to build this celebration of community and cuisine. Despite the time constraints, the team managed to create a fully-realized world complete with engaging characters, cheerful dialogue, and themed musical accompaniment.

## Gameplay Overview
Players become the custodians of Teetering Towers, a vertical community united by their love of freshly-baked pies.

Bakers will leave their pies on the window to cool, and it's up to you to tell them when it's
ready to eat! But don't wait too long, or the pies will go bad and be thrown in the alley -- and that raccoon is big
enough already!

As you sell more pies, your tower will grow taller and taller. How high will your pies rise?
