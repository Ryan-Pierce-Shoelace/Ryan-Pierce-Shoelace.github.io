Although relatively new to the game development scene, I have always been an avid gamer. My favorites being those with rich stories and atmosphere such as Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption, Bethesda’s Skyrim, Blizzard’s Overwatch, and Galactic Cafe’s The Stanley Parable. Playing games like these showed me the importance of game polish and how it defines a player’s experience with a game.
