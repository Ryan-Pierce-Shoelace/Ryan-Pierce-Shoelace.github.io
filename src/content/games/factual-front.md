Created as part of the 'Pirate Software - Game Jam 14' for the theme 'it spreads' FACTUAL FRONT is a game about the spread of fake news.

Developed in only two weeks most of the time was focused on getting the mechanics working. This was a good learning experience as it showed me a lot about Text-Mesh Pro. We spent a bit too much time iterating and tweaking the basic mechanics and didn't leave enough time for testing.

There are some issues with the game currently with the gameplay loop that could be overhauled with a bit of time but the idea itself feels like it could be good.
