HITCHED is a devilishly challenging puzzle game that transforms the everyday struggle of trailer parking into an explosive gaming experience. Developed in an intense 48-hour period for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam, this solo project embraces the jam's theme of 'Joined Together' in both its mechanics and spirit.

## Development Background

Created entirely by one developer pushing the boundaries of what could be accomplished in just two days, HITCHED emerged from the ashes of a scrapped prototype that consumed the first six hours of development. This setback only fueled the determination to create something unique and engaging in the remaining time.

## About the Game

Players face increasingly complex parking challenges while managing a vehicle permanently attached to a temperamental trailer. Each level introduces new obstacles, from innocent traffic cones to nerve-wracking explosive barrels, creating a perfect storm of precision driving and puzzle-solving.

## Key Features

- Realistic trailer physics that capture the authentic challenge of reverse parking
- Progressively complex level design that tests both patience and skill
- Dual control scheme supporting both keyboard and gamepad inputs
- Minimalist 3D art style focusing on gameplay clarity
- Strategic placement of explosive hazards adding tension to each maneuver

## Technical Implementation

This game showcases my growth as a developer with its polished gameplay.

This game is primarily about the struggle of trying to drive with a trailer taken to the extreme. Levels will mostly
involve reversing with your trailer and trying to avoid pylons. Then just adding some explosive barrels to the mix to
keep up the pressure.
