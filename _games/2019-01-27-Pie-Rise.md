Created during the 2019 Global Game Jam in Edmonton, PIE RISE was developed by a team of five, including an artist, a writer, and three programmers. The theme, "The Feeling Home Gives You", led us to create a game about baking. We managed to polish nearly every aspect of our 48-hour project, adding cheerful dialogues and music.

What's better than freshly-baked pies? In this casual game, you will help the residents of Teetering Towers grow their community by selling pies. Bakers will leave their pies on the window to cool, and it's up to you to tell them when it's ready to eat! But don't wait too long, or the pies will go bad and be thrown in the alley -- and that raccoon is big enough already! 

As you sell more pies, your tower will grow taller and taller. How high will your pies rise?
