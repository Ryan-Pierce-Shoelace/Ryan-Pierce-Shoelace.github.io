name: "Xuul"
role: "Game Developer"
bio: "Awarded Time's Person of the Year in 2006. Creator and lover of bad jokes and good stories. Some of my favorite games involve puzzles, philosophy and strategy. I am inspired by titles liked The Outer Wilds, The Talos Principle, Prey(2016) and Dishonered. I want to make things that make people think just as much as they feel.
You might know me from my Youtube Channel where I make modding guides and tutorials."
