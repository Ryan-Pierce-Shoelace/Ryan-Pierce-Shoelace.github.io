In this unsettling\r\nexploration of suburban life, you step into the shoes of a man whose simple to-do list becomes a descent into madness.\r\n\r\n## Development Background\r\n\r\nCreated by a core team of two developers during November's GitHub Game Off 2024, \"The List\" was built with a focus on\r\natmospheric storytelling and psychological horror. The game embraces the jam's theme of \"Secrets\" while also\r\nincorporating the \"Small Palette\" wildcard challenge, limiting the visual design to just four colors to create a stark,\r\nhaunting atmosphere.\r\n\r\n## About the Game\r\n\r\nIn this 2D horror experience, players navigate through a seemingly normal suburban home, completing everyday tasks from\r\na to-do list. However, as the game progresses, the protagonist's grip on reality begins to slip, and the true nature of\r\nthe house's dark secrets starts to emerge.\r\n\r\n## Theme Interpretation\r\n\r\nThe concept of \"Secrets\" is woven throughout the game's narrative, manifesting as deep, dark truths the protagonist has\r\nlocked away. These hidden elements add layers of mystery to the gameplay, encouraging players to piece together the\r\ndisturbing story of what really happened within the house's walls.\r\n\r\n## Key Features\r\n\r\n- Atmospheric 2D horror gameplay\r\n- Psychological narrative that unravels as you progress\r\n- Four-color palette creating a distinct visual style\r\n- Simple but increasingly unsettling task-based gameplay\r\n- Hidden story elements that reward thorough exploration\r\n\r\n## Development Notes\r\n\r\nThe game was built with a strong emphasis on environmental storytelling and psychological horror rather than jump\r\nscares. The limited color palette, imposed by the wildcard challenge, became a crucial element in establishing the\r\ngame's unsettling atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Source Code Available on GitHub](https://github.com/Ryan-Pierce-Shoelace/The-List--GameOff-2024-Secrets)","src/content/games/the-list.md","97191bbe525e852e",{"html":254,"metadata":255},"\u003Cp>“The List” is a psychological horror game developed in seven days for the GitHub Game Off 2024 jam.
