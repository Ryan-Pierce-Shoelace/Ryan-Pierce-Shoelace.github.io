name: "Ryan 'Shoelace' Pierce"
role: "Game Developer"
bio: "I’m a programmer and game developer with a passion for creating fun, engaging experiences that players can connect with. Over the years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from fast-paced racers to story-driven visual novels, focusing on gameplay programming, AI systems, and UI/UX design.

I love solving problems and building tools that make games better, whether that’s designing intuitive interfaces or crafting systems that bring worlds to life. Inspired by games like The Outer Wilds, Skyrim, Rimworld, and The Stanley Parable, I’m drawn to projects with rich stories, memorable characters, immersive atmospheres, and systemic gameplay.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably brainstorming new game ideas, diving into indie titles, or tinkering with ways to make my next project even better."
