Created as part of the 'Pirate Software - Game Jam 14' for the theme 'it spreads' FACTUAL FRONT is a game about the spread of fake news. 

Developed in only two weeks most of the time was focused on getting the mechanics working. This was a good learning experience as it showed me a lot about Text-Mesh Pro. We spent a bit too much time iterating and tweaking the basic mechanics and didn't leave enough time for testing. 

There are some issues with the game currently with the gameplay loop that could be overhauled with a bit of time but the idea itself feels like it could be good.

In an era where trust in journalism is at an all time low, while the spread of misinformation is unmatched, Factual Front stands apart as an arbiter of truth.

You assume the role of a new fact checker, on the front lines in the fight for the truth. Parse through the data in the modern news room.  Will you spread fact or fiction in this era of political scandal, war, and misinformation? Or will you hunt down the truth, even if it costs you your job?

Impact the world: What you publish can change the world around you. 

Cite your sources, or don't: Research takes time, and just as in the real world, some may be willing to bend the truth if things become easier

Dive into a world of politics and scandal: Enter a fictionalized world of American politics. Learn the backstories of several characters, see the scandals unfold. And try not to cry when you realize all of it is somehow less depressing than the actual political situation around the world.

Research Topics: With a laptop and two entire websites at your disposable the only limit was the time I had to actual write articles and posts.... and maybe your imagination.

You are in control: Send stories off the be published, or melt them down in the toxic vat of distilled internet comments.
